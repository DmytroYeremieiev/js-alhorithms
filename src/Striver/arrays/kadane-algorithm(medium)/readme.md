# Kadane’s Algorithm : Maximum Subarray Sum in an Array(Medium)

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array arr, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and returns its sum and prints the subarray.

Examples:

```javascript
Example 1:

Input: arr = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] 

Output: 6 

Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6. 

Examples 2: 

Input: arr = [1] 

Output: 1 

Explanation: Array has only one element and which is giving positive sum of 1. 
```
